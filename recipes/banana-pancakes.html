    <p>I'm going to show you how to make an easy two ingredient banana pancake recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>The ratio is 2 eggs for 1 banana and will yield about two big pancakes</li> 
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine your eggs and banana together, I like to use a meat pounder or an electric whisk. Make sure it achieves a smooth texture with minimal chunks</li>
        <li>While whisking heat up your pan with whatever oil you choose. I always prefer butter.</li>
        <li>Add mixture to the pan and allow each side to cook until solid, flipping consistently to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Once finished serve with peanut butter, maple syrup, and more sliced bananas.</li>
    </ol>
